<p>I&rsquo;been always thinking on writting stuff on the WWW, but never really get full into it, until now, so i would like to give the welcome to what inteend to be be my new blog/site where you can find all about the things that i&rsquo;m most inerested on, you can expect to find stuff such as</p>

<li>Programming (Python, Javascritp, Swift and bit of everything)</li>
<li>WWII</li>
<li>Podcast</li>
<li>RPG games</li>
</ul>
<p>Before digging into different topics i would like Introduce myself, my name is Ethan Escare침o Rosano, and i&rsquo;m from Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico at the moment of writting this post i work as a Software Engineer on different projects around the globe, more exactly on Web Development, but i hope to someday in the short-future start my own startup</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gradutated from the Universidad Tecnologica de Tamaulipas Norte with an Engineering degree on Network and telecomunications</p>
<p>Did some IT jobs for relative &ldquo;big&rdquo; companies here on Reynosa before moving 100% remote as a software engineer</p>
<p>I do enjoy to 1 and only 1 video game on the PC named <a href="http://tibia.com/">tibia</a> and made some <a href="">small</a><a href="https://github.com/Ethaan/nodejs-tibia-api">https://github.com/Ethaan/nodejs-tibia-api</a> <a href="https://github.com/Ethaan/medivia-python-api">open</a> <a href="https://github.com/ethkat/tibia-ts3-teamspeakbot">source projects</a> for it, i used to enjoy playing soccer (alot) but right now i just don&rsquo;t find it any funny, mostly because i&rsquo;m really bad at it</p>
<p>Among my favorite bands of all time i must say <a href="https://nosomosmarineros.bandcamp.com/">no somos marineros</a> is my favorite at the moment, together with <a href="https://toucheamore.bandcamp.com/">touche amore</a>, <a href="https://titlefightmusic.bandcamp.com/">title fight</a> and <a href="https://joliette.bandcamp.com/">joliette</a></p>
