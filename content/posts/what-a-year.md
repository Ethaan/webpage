2020 was a _weird_ year, it was the year where some us are stuck in our homes since March, and _we_ still here, going *strong*.

There is much i can say about 2020, but i don't really want to romanticize this year, it was a *shitty* year and thats it(period)

But as i always tell my wife/friends, i try to grab the best of every scenario, and thats what i did, how? let me explain.


## Personal

First of all, our first baby was born on September 29 and we named it _Kai_, and i will be honest, its been one of the most exiting and exhausting experience of my whole life, i been learning SO MUCH from being a parent in this past 9 weeks, how to be a better Husband.

> There are many things i would say to anyone about having a baby, but for me the most important is _have a great relationship with your partner_ really, this sounds pretty obvious but think about it, when the baby wake up at 4AM on Wednesday and you and your parent have both been working for 12hrs non-stop (while working from home T_T) + making food + making groceries and whatever other adulthood sh*t, you will need a partner there, "you prepare the milk i will change the diaper" or you will need confidence to say (and the other equal will don't get mad) "i'm just to tired today can you feed the baby?", thats why communication matters.

## Professional

2020 was the year where me and my wife _finally_ did *click* on the tech world, after 5 years of *HARD* work

<hr style="border:2px solid gray"> </hr>

When i say we work really really hard this past 5 years, trust me, we did it, at some point in our career we where working for 7 different clients at the same time with different technologies, you might be wondering why?, well i can think on a few reasons for that

- You can't get nice 6 figures salaries if you are *not* willing to move outside Mexico + remote + less than 5 years of experience, but what about 3 jobs for 40K a year? (you get the idea)
- We wanted to be debt free and life ready by 27, which means full house, full gadgets and all those things it normally takes more than 5 years
- Experience, we figured out that, there is no better way of gaining experience more than working on very different projects, from Python Backends to React-Vue JS frontend or fullstack with Meteor, even doing Chrome extensions or only Payment integrations, we did as much as we could.

<hr style="border:2px solid gray"> </hr>

the period of when we did that was since we finish college mid 2014 to September-October 2019, so what do i mean when we talk about *click*?, well we did a few things

First of all we finally start paying for actual good content, i know everything its on the internet but if you want to really put into your education, you need to _invest_, and you might be wondering, how do we invest?

Well we pay for a few things, and we use what we already have, this is

[Egghead](https://egghead.io/)

[Epic React](https://epicreact.dev/learn)

[Testing Javascript](https://testingjavascript.com/)

[AlgoExpert + SystemsExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/product)


And a few bunch of books 

There is an important comment i want to do here, when you buy this kind of content, remember its not a race to finish, you are studding to get an A score on a test, you want to actually learn, you might be doing the same chapter/video a couple of times, or stuck on the same topic for 1 week, thats OK, this kind of stuff its not easy

There are also another few things we are doing time-to-time and trying to make this a hobby

- Getting rest, staying away from the PC as much as possible, <-- this was actually SUPER important, there is some work you need to do to understand, work-studying its not OK, been on the PC 15hrs a day its not OK
- Join discord/slack servers to bee up to date with the community
- Join twitter and follow relevant people
- Work with technologies that really interest us, not just because "its the trend"

### Goals

I still don't have that much goals for 2021, and honestly i don't think i will have any *new* goal, i would like to keep my current goals and maybe make them Goals v2.

I'm an strong believer that you don't need to always been pushing for new goals, or something new, its OK to be conformable for a _whathever-time_ you want and just enjoy the gains of all your hard work

Buuuuut, there is one thing i'm actually working since this week, and thats Open source, this is something that was on my list for many years, honestly since like day 1, but i never had the time (remember those 7 projects??), i will try to get involved on projects i found interesting such as [rome tools](https://github.com/rome/tools) and [blitz](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz), hopefully in 12-13months from now i can come with a new post where i talk about my experience on open source.

## Outro

With nothing more to say, i will let you with a few sonds that where with me this past months
