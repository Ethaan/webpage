I've always thought on writting stuff on the WWW, but I never got full hands to it, until now, so I would like to welcome you to what intends to be my new blog/site where you can find all about the things that I'm most interested in, you can expect to find stuff such as:

- Music (mostly punk)
- Programming (Python, Javascript, Swift and bit of everything)
- WWII
- Podcast
- RPG games

Before digging into different topics I would like introduce myself. My name is Ethan Escare√±o Rosano, and I'm from Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico, at the moment of writting this post I work as a Software Engineer on different projects around the globe, more exactly on Web Development, but I hope to someday in the short-future start my own startup.

I'm gradutated from the Universidad Tecnologica de Tamaulipas Norte with an Engineering degree on Network and Telecomunications.

Did some IT jobs for relative "big" companies here on Reynosa before moving 100% remote as a software engineer.

I enjoy only 1 PC game called [tibia](http://tibia.com/) and I have made some [small]()https://github.com/Ethaan/nodejs-tibia-api [open](https://github.com/Ethaan/medivia-python-api) [source projects](https://github.com/ethkat/tibia-ts3-teamspeakbot) for it. I used to enjoy playing soccer (a lot) but right now I just don't find it fun anymore, mostly because I'm really bad at it.

Among my favorite bands of all times I must say [no somos marineros](https://nosomosmarineros.bandcamp.com/) is my favorite at the moment, along with [touche amore](https://toucheamore.bandcamp.com/), [title fight](https://titlefightmusic.bandcamp.com/) and [joliette](https://joliette.bandcamp.com/) 

And I think that's all I want to share about my personal life for now.

shwooz.
