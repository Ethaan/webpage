## Whats up

I'been always thinking on writting stuff on the WWW, but never really get full into it, until now, so i would like to give the welcome to what inteend to be be my new blog/site where you can find all about the things that i'm most inerested on, you can expect to find stuff such as

- Music (mostly punk)
- Programming (Python, Javascritp, Swift and bit of everything)
- WWII
- Podcast
- RPG games

Before digging into different topics i would like Introduce myself, my name is Ethan Escare√±o Rosano, and i'm from Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico at the moment of writting this post i work as a Software Engineer on different projects around the globe, more exactly on Web Development, but i hope to someday in the short-future start my own startup

I'm gradutated from the Universidad Tecnologica de Tamaulipas Norte with an Engineering degree on Network and telecomunications

Did some IT jobs for relative "big" companies here on Reynosa before moving 100% remote as a software engineer

I do enjoy to 1 and only 1 video game on the PC named [tibia](http://tibia.com/) and made some [small]()https://github.com/Ethaan/nodejs-tibia-api [open](https://github.com/Ethaan/medivia-python-api) [source projects](https://github.com/ethkat/tibia-ts3-teamspeakbot) for it, i used to enjoy playing soccer (alot) but right now i just don't find it any funny, mostly because i'm really bad at it

Among my favorite bands of all time i must say [no somos marineros](https://nosomosmarineros.bandcamp.com/) is my favorite at the moment, together with [touche amore](https://toucheamore.bandcamp.com/), [title fight](https://titlefightmusic.bandcamp.com/) and [joliette](https://joliette.bandcamp.com/) 

And i think thats the most i would like to share about my personal life
