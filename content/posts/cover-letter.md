## Recluiter.

Hi.

As my [Whats up ]({{< ref "whats-up.md" >}}) describe me at a personal level, this post inteent to describe myself as a Software Engineer.

### Backgroud.

Been OK with the idea of spent 18hrs a day in front of the computer since i was 13years old, but not doing actually something productive until i was
20years old~.

Work for a big IT company on the IT departament for 4years before switching to a remote-programming job, since then been wearing many hats on many startups.

### Skills

Since the very start i use **PHP** for the college with **MySQL**, then when i get my really first job it was with **Javascript** and **Mongo** (using the **MeteorJS** framework for many small startups/workshops) in between i start learning and practicing **Python** until i get a chance to land a job for a fintech company, we use **Django**, then i jump to work with **VueJS** for 13 months exactly at [Edthena](https://www.edthena.com/), on the hand i got a sidejob at a [German startup](https://www.schrott24.de/) where i did use a bunch of **React** with **nodejs** on the other hand i join [Sapien](https://www.sapien.network/) as one of the first engineering on the team, using initially **MeteorJS** and then migrating to a more wide stack with **PostgresSQL** **redis** **nodejs** **graphql** **elixir** and **React** , furthrmore i did also join the company [Zipdev](https://zipdev.com/) where i get some projects to work on, here is where i finally get my first job as a **Python** Developer, meanwhile on the side i start getting really deep on the **Swift** language, as a last point the past few months i been getting alot in **typescript**, as a side point i don't have any kind of strong opinion on how to style any application, but i would go strong with **tailwindcss** from now, and have solid experience with **stylus**, been using **styled-components** also on client projects.

Will working on all this gigs and spending a bunch of time on my computer, i like to do a few katas on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Ethaan/published_kumite) or try to help someone on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3961546/ethaan) and maybe get a few dollars on [codementor](https://www.codementor.io/@ethaan) (i don't use it that much as today)

### What I did wrong?

There are always thing i do wrong, on every job, i somehow fuck up something, but the good thing is that, the more i grow the more this "fuck up" affect less to my team or my company.

I would like to start by doing what i did wrong on my few gigs, or my whole career actually.

1.- At my first gigs on this IT company i was still a freshman and i was lazy enought to ask questions, i lost that opportunity people have to actually ask questions and concerns, i start as an intern and never really grow, pretty frustating.

2.- On my first freelancer work, i was hired and can only last for 1 month, my code was gargabe and i sell myself as a really experienced developer, ended up working 2 weeks for free and then other real senior developer take the project and i was out

3.- I got the opportunity to get another really quick, like in 24hrs, i did last for just 2 months and i was let go, i was not good enought yet to be part of a team.

4.- At my second year, when get confortable with my work, i did stop learning/trying new stuff, i was to confortable and then in the short-future that really play me wrong.

### What Im scared of

As a self-learn comming from Mexico, been on the USA remote industry of software can be challening, you see kids on NY comming from Ivy colleges making 200K a year just because they can solve whiteboard algos, thats scare, even as a grow adult.

1.- Be on an interview, i don't hate them, they can be fun, but i'm scared of get into the conclusion i'm not that good enought, that I'm a 28years dude with a wife and a kid that can answer/solve tricky questions, it hits hard.

2.- Can be enough, don't take my wrong, i do my best day to day get CS concepts, Algorithms, Data types, videos, ideas, still as a self learn ALWAYS remote employee, moving alone can be scare, how do you know you are going into the right direction? there are no mentors, its you and thats it


### The good things

I consider myself as a enthusiast programmer, which like to go and understand things as far as my mind can go, trying day to day to learn more in deep about how to be a better programmer, reading all the blog-posts/books and watching all the videos i can get.

**Can do attitude**, I don't think there is no such thing you can't accomplish, alone or with a team, in 1 hour or 1 week, i belive there is an skill of taking a big task and make it smaller tasks, there is also another good thing i did learn in the past years, and thats saying "hey i need help" or "i don't know if that solution is the best one", understanding and teaching myself that sometimes you are not the smartes people on the room is hard but really rewarding when learn it.

**Communicative** and **responsable**, can be also listed here, as this is avery board skill, as each day pass i can see the value of communicate to my teammates, in the form of a question or an answer, there are ways to help and ask for help and doing it right can make you fit on a team really quick.

**Move fast**, but move right, there is a big difference of moving fast but also make the correct decisions while doing it, by experience i can tell that even if you want to move fast, that dosen't mean there should be a lack of planing behind it.

**Experience**, been on the industry for a while enought to understand whats the role of a good engineering on the team, giving solutions and not only problems, do your code, push when needed, rest when possible.

**can start quick**, There are a few examples where the project push myself to go forward, a good one is when i was confortable enought on Javascript and then got switched to a Python team, with no experience on it, got a few weeks to learn the language and then jump to work on a bottle API, then worked with no issues for 9months, then when getting back to the frontend team, React was different with `hooks` and `typescript` and other stuff there, still getting up to speed in a few days.

### Why to hire me?

If you need someone with experience on startups, that is willing to work on any stack, need things to get done, someone that can manage an small team to succeed, someone with no ego but still can effectively defend his own opinions, someone that can take critics and improve it not only related to code but in general, someone that has never left a project/team/client with un-done work, someone that give you results, then i'm a good fit for you.

I will do my best to prove the above statement, with my day to day work.


And i think thats all i have to say to you, my future employer, if you got a position that uses Javascript/Typescript, Python or Swift, you might wanna take a look into my profile, i might be a good fit you (or not T_T).
